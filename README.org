* Rick and Morty
Hi! I'm studying full-stack web development at Soy Henry.
This project is divided in two sections. One part is the front-end using React, Redux, and Hooks. The another part is the server side, for now it does not have much. This is a project to practice what I'm learning.

* Special thanks.
Special thanks to [[https://github.com/FacundoAylan][FacundoAylan]] for helping me with the styling and to my teachers at Henry. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how I can improve this project, feel free to let me know!
